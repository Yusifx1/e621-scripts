# e621-scripts
Pool, set, tag and etc downloaders for e621

Basic script that use curl and jq. Work with wget to but i planned for android download less. If you want i can write instruction or script. 

Don't blame me pls. It's my first script ever. I writed it with phone on text editor and tested on termux. That's mean this must work on Android. Reason of writing this new api of site and only Android system usage. 


# USAGE

jq and curl needed

bash "script which you want"

Then type id or name for set

# DESCRIPTION

For pools:

Pool.sh- Two mode fast(dwo=no) and litle bit slow (dwo=yes). If you have problem with order with first mode activate second mode (dwo=yes) (this dependent by pool ordering).

For sets:

Set - (sc=on) downloads set posts by id with renaming (oldest upload first). sc=no download sets with source name. 

# TO-DO

Pass e621/e926 limitation. (In progress.) 

Add progressbar instead curl progress meter (-# not work correct).
