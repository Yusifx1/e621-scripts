# e621-scripts
Pool, set, tag and etc downloaders for e621

Basic script that use curl and jq. Work with wget to but i planned for android download less. If you want i can write instruction or script. Now with all in one and removed direction variable selection because it was useless. You can change it in code if you want select directory. Change dir=$"where you want" or $id typed by id begining of script. Also removed base.cfg. Now you shoul write varibles in main script (allinone.sh)

Don't blame me pls. It's my first script ever. I writed it with phone on text editor and tested on termux. That's mean this must work on Android. Reason of writing this new api of site and only Android system usage. 


# USAGE

jq and curl needed

bash "script which you want"

Then type id or shortname for set

#Writing login and API key

log=login=tysh1 # Your e621 login. Tysh1 is my nickname on e621. 
api=api_key=dvgdgd... # Your e621 api key. No my api key not start with dvgdgd i just spammed keyboard. DONT TRY HACK MY E621 ACCOUNT!!! 

# DESCRIPTION
Now all in one. Run script select what you want download by number. Then type id/shortname for set or tags. 
Tags example: furry+hat+-dragon+cute
This will show posts with furry, hat, cute and without dragon tags. 

+add tag
-exclude added tag

Changed separate scripts. Now it work like this:

bash "script name" "poolid or set id/shortname or tags" 

Old slective scripts will be in old scripts folder. 

For pools:

Pool.sh- Two mode fast(dwo=no) and litle bit slow (dwo=yes). If you have problem with order with first mode activate second mode (dwo=yes) (this dependent by pool ordering).

For sets:

Set - (sc=on) downloads set posts by id with renaming (oldest upload first). sc=no download sets with source name.
