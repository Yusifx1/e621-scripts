If you want use script like this from any directory

e621downloader pool 19111

Follow this steps:

1) Download script

2) Star and wath my script in github

3) Now you need copy or move file to /usr/bin folder. 

In terminal run this

cp e621downloader.sh /usr/bin/CustomNameHere && chmod +x /usr/bin/CustomNameHere

On android Termux app (don't forget give storage permission "termux-setup-storage")

cp e621downloader.sh $PREFIX/bin/CustomNameHere && chmod +x $PREFIX/bin/CustomNameHere

Else it not work on Termux (like if app updated)

 when you launch you type "cd .." to go up directory. Then "cp home/storage/path/to/your/script usr/bin/"name that will run script like: e621, yiff-time, e621downloader and etc."
and then give running access with chmod +x usr/bin/"your script"

If you followed all step you can go path what you want like "cd storage/shared" (main internal storage of android) and run script like this

e621 https://e621.net/posts_sets/26089 dump

yiffdownloader pool 19353 both yes

Also you can edit default parametrs with text editor like nano. Just go to usr/bin and edit your script. Or make listed steps again.
